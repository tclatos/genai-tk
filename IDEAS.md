# use key-value store factory 
use py-key-value-aio

# markdown
all option to generate HMTMl with  Edgeparse
 
Implement a "jsonify" version with liteparse v2

# Skill
inspired by https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/15116 ? 

# scafolding
- suggest after init to install BAML : uv run baml-cli init --dest <PATH>   

# tokenization
use https://github.com/chonkie-inc/tokie 


Create a command calling a worflow that 
- cli workflow run baml_extract --set base_dir="$ONEDRIVE/prj/RFQ_pricing" --set output_dir="$ONEDRIVE/prj/RFQ_pricing/out"  --set function_name=ExtractRUFacts   --set pathspecs='["MERGED.md"]' --set llm=gpt-oss-120@openrouter --force

# BAML
Develop Workflows to generate structured output with BAML, usable through the 'cli workflow run" command, and composable . Update  commands 'cli  baml extract' and 'cli  baml run' so they call  'cli workfow'  (they will likely be depreciated later)

# Model to Table CSV
Create a Workflown that takes a JSON file, a Pydantic model and a list of keys, and generate a table in CSV or Excel format. 
Then create a workflox that  combine it with the BAML workflow previously created.

# TOC

We want to implement commands and Prefect tasks to create a table of content (TOC) from a Markdown document. 
Inspiration is : 
- https://pageindex.ai/blog/pageindex-intro 
- https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/blob/main/pageindex/page_index_md.py
- https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/blob/main/examples/agentic_vectorless_rag_demo.py 


 Take inspiration of PageIndex parameters, use our own convention to select the LLM, the class, etc. 

First implement in genai-tk a simple workfow callable from 'cli workflow run' to create TOC from fiven markdown files. 
/home/tcl/prj/genai-tk/genai_tk/workflow

Then integrate it in ...

# Anonymimisation / LLM Routing demo
Create a Streamlit app that demonstrate features 
examples/notebooks/anonymize_rag_pipeline_demo.ipynb
examples/notebooks/middleware_anonymization_demo.ipynb

- The user select a short text among several prompt you have created, with different level of sensitivity
- it can either anonymize the prompt, or send it to a safe LLM, or both
- After submition, the possibly anomyzized text is displayed, and the destinated LLM, and some context informarion to explai  the choice
- The result returned with LLM is displayed
- the user can visualize the configurarauon and oyther information to understand how it works


## Ladybug embeddings

We want to store in Ladybug the embeddings of some kinf of documents.  







# Better file spec
use  https://github.com/cpburnz/python-pathspec 



## Improve Embedders
-  hane new FastEmbedEmbeddings provider: https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain-community/embeddings/fastembed/FastEmbedEmbeddings  ; https://qdrant.github.io/fastembed/examples/Supported_Models 
- add category (sparce, reranking, image, ..)

## Around Agents
- Test the AioSandboxBackend (taken from DeerFlow, and made compatible with Langchain protocol) to work with Deep agents and Deepagent-cli. 

- Develop classical Deep Agents use case  , to run without too much change  (skill,  toools, MCP, ..) either in Deer-flow, Deeppagent-cli and our Langchain generic agent : research agent, coder agent, DB expert agent, etc...  
    - Test with several consiguration (sandbox, LLM, ...)
    - See https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/tree/main/examples/  and Deer-flow 

- Implement Sub-agents  in our generic Langchain agent YAML config file

- Develop a better Anonimization Middleware, based on our Presidio extension and langchain build-in middleware

- Improve or replace our Rich based CLI by a Textual based one, inspired by deep-agent-cli 

- Implement an API for our agents, inspired by the one in Deep-Flow, so we could reuse its front-end to quick start a project

 - Integrate open-code in similar way than deep-flow, lanchain, deepagents  (using https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode-sdk-python)


## Other  

###  Markdown loader
Refactor /workflow/loaders/markdown_loader.py with improvement from /workflow/rag/markdown_chunking.py.
Keep a LangChain interface (ie Document + metadata instead of ChunkInfo - as TypedDict if possible - and inherit BaseLoader ).
Replace code in genai-graph that uses markdown_chunking with the LangChain compatible loader/splitter. 
Add test cases.
Consider using PageIndex (of be inspired by) to have a TOC and a better structure (https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex/blob/main/pageindex/page_index_md.py)


###  RAG
Refactor totaly  /home/tcl/prj/genai-tk/genai_tk/tools/langchain/rag_tool_factory.py .  
The created LangChain tool should behave like the 'query' command in /home/tcl/prj/genai-tk/genai_tk/workflow/rag/commands_rag.py, ie accept a query string and an optional metadata filter in JSON. 
In the factory, we pass the name of the embedding store (to be used by EmbeddingsStore.create_from_config...) , 
tool name, tool descripton and default metadata filter  (to be merge with the one given when calling the tool).
look at /home/tcl/prj/genai-tk/genai_tk/tools/langchain/sql_tool_factory.py, that works.


 ## better LiteLLM support

- Refactor  get_litellm_model_name  so it works with our new LlmFactory and with more providers.
- Allow LiteLLM naming in complement to our own ( ex: uv run cli core llm -i 'tell me a jole' -m openrouter/google/openai/gpt-4.1-mini  )


## Hybrid search extension to genai_tk/core/embeddings_store.py
- use BM25S + Spacy (but configurable)


# Misc
Use https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt for @once



# CLI
cli workflow run baml_extract --set base_dir="$ONEDRIVE/prj/RFQ_pricing" --set output_dir="$ONEDRIVE/prj/RFQ_pricing/out"  --set function_name=ExtractRUFacts   --set pathspecs='["MERGED.md"]' --set llm=gpt5-mini@edenai --force
